Overview
&quot;L&#039;italiano al punto giusto!&quot; now with free supplementary resources in English!

This modern task-based course pays particular attention to vocabulary and the development of effective communication skills, highlighting the key aspects of Italian grammar throughout. The clear and simple structure is easy to follow, while the motivating topics, activities and end-of-unit tasks encourage interest, participation and social interaction both within and outside of the classroom.

The student&#039;s books include additional cultural resources on a variety of topics: art, history, famous people, geography, the Made in Italy industry. Other features include a final grammar summary and an exercise section specially designed to complement study for the CILS, CELI, PLIDA and CLIQ exams (official examinations in Italian as a foreign language certified by exam boards in Italy).

Al dente is a compact all-in-one course: the student&#039;s book and workbook for each level come together in one single volume. Also included are all the audio tracks on CD plus authentic original video material on DVD. The teacher&#039;s guides and digital resources suitable for the Interactive Whiteboard are available separately, while the answer keys, audio tracks in MP3 format and the audio and video transcripts are also available to download free online.
